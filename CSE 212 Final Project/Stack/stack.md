# STACKS
## In this lesson I am going to talk about Stacks and some examples where stacks can applied in real life.
## I will cover what a Stack is.
## And I will cover Stack Operations that incude Push, Pop and Peek
## What is a stack?
A stack is very similar to the idea of what a physical stack would look like. The  stack data structure
allows us to place a variabel or object on it. A very simple example of how the idea of stacks can be explained is to think
of four books. Book A, Book B Book C and Book D and they are spread accross a table.
Lets say you organize these books with A being the first one then you pile up B,C and D on top of each other.
We now have a bice stack of Books!
If we want to read book A we need to take down books starting with D then C and then B to get  to A
That is the idea behind a data structure stacks.

# STACK OPERATIONS
Wwe have the Push Pop and Peek.

## We will start with the Push.
The operation  to insert elements in a stack is called a push. When you push  the book on a stack we put the 
book on top the previous book or element. When we say push elements onto a stack we insert an element on to a 
stack and the last element to be added is the usually on top of the stack.

## Pop
Popping is when we take the top most book on our stack and put it down.  When we remonve an elemtn from a stack the stack
follows the First in Last out property. This means that the top element which is last to eb inserted is removed
when we perfrom the pop operation.

## Peek
The Peek  opertion retruns the top most element in stack. Lets say we pop the first two books in our stack
the peek function will retyrn the top most book in our stack. So if remove Book D and Book C, what will
the peek function return? Book B.
